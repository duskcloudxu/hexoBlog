# Note on Seven Language in Seven weeks

## The basic rules I learned (or realized)

It is known to me that if you have learnt a programming language, you would learn your next programming language much faster, and the more language you learn, the faster you would be. To me, the most obvious reason is that "Oh, I have seen this in that language", and of course there should be more than that and I just feel hard to express it explicitly. But this book, Seven Language in Seven weeks(Seven Languages as below), gives a very detailed guide to le arn an language for an experienced programmer and also give me the answer that why more language you learn, faster you would be in learning.

### 7 rules to learn an new language

- The typing model
  - Strong/Weak(implicit conversion or not)
  - Static/Dynamic(declare type in compiler time or not)
- Programming Model
  - Object-oriented(OO)>
  - Functional?
  - Procedural?
- How to interact
  - Compiled and run?
  - Interactive shell?
- The decision constructs and core data structures
  - Do you use for, if?
  - Do you use block?
  - Do you use...meta programming?
- Core features that makes
  - What the language for?
    - Like javascript for browser/web development
    - Like java for building large system
